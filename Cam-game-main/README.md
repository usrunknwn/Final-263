## How it's built.
Mythic Clash uses p5js, posenet and collide2d for all its gameplay. 

## How to play
The game features two players on opposite sides of the screen, Players can extend their arm straight to shoot a fireball then bend their arm to form a shield which can block fireballs. The goal is to get the other players health down to 0. Make sure to keep a large space between the players and the camera, as well as have a blank wall behind the players. The game is suppose to played with a projector, where you project the game infront of the players. Ethernet connection is recommend.

With a redesign to fit the indie retro play design style, an instructions screen was also featured.

## Known Issues and the Future
Posenet is not fast and perfect, with two players on screen it can get pretty glitchy.  
For future updates I would like to add different colors for each player as well as a leaderboard.
